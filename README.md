### Hi there 👋

In an ever shifting technological landscape, where complexity grows faster than abstractions, I work as a Software & Data and Machine Learning Engineer focused on building resilient, cloud native, and intelligence driven platforms, currently with focus on GenAI (agent pattern, data retrieval, multi agent protocol). My work is not just about delivering systems, but about designing digital ecosystems that scale human potential and enable engineers to operate with clarity, autonomy, and purpose.

# About Me

With over 15 years of experience architecting and securing large scale technology environments, my career has been a journey through the core of computing from the rigors of **UNIX Systems Administration** and **Offensive Security** to the modern paradigms of **Software Engineering, CloudOps, DevOps, SRE, and DataOps.**

Today, my professional focus has converged at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and System Dependability** within the high-stakes world of Banking and Financial Technology.

### Professional Evolution & Current Focus
After a long career mastering the full stack of modern infrastructure, I am now fully dedicated to:

* **AI-Driven Resilience:** Applying Machine Learning to predict, detect, and mitigate failure modes in complex financial ecosystems.

### Academic Research
I am currently a Master's Researcher at the **Technological Institute of Aeronautics [ITA](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/technological-institute-aeronautics)**. My research focuses on the **MECADE** model a framework designed to integrate Chaos Engineering into the dependability assessment of financial institutions, ensuring that the global economy’s digital backbone remains resilient under pressure.

### The Paradox of the Generalist Specialist

In a world that often rewards narrow specialization, I embrace the paradox of being a generalist with specialist depth. My curiosity is systematic, not scattered. I seek patterns, abstractions, and hidden connections across disciplines, transforming complexity into coherent mental models and practical solutions.

My daily discipline is shaped by a commitment to growth across intellectual, technical, leadership, and creative dimensions. Progress, to me, is not about accumulation, but about integration. Seeing further by connecting what others treat as isolated domains.

The ocean is both metaphor and compass, a reminder of scale, depth, and humility. Beyond technology, my interests include jiujitsu, wellness and body conditioning, meaningful networking, and the quiet precision of nanquim drawing, where contrast, restraint, and intention reveal essence through simplicity.
