### Hi there 👋

In an ever shifting technological landscape where complexity often outpaces abstraction, I think resilient, intelligence driven ecosystems. As a Software, Data, and Machine Learning Engineer, my current focus lies at the frontier of Applied GenAI-engineering sophisticated agent patterns and multi-agent protocols. My work transcends system delivery; it is about designing digital environments that scale human potential, allowing engineers to operate with profound clarity, autonomy, and purpose.

# About Me

With over 15 years of experience architecting and securing large-scale technology environments, my career has been a journey through the core of computing from the rigors of **UNIX Systems Administration** and **Offensive Security** to the modern paradigms of **Software Engineering, CloudOps, DevOps, SRE, and DataOps.**

Today, my professional focus has converged at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and some of flavours of Machine Learning technics* within the high stakes world of Banking and Financial Technology.

### Professional Evolution & Current Focus
After a long career mastering the full stack of modern infrastructure, I am now fully dedicated to the frontier of **Applied Artificial Intelligence**:

* **Agentic AI Architecture:** Engineering sophisticated **Agent Patterns** using a hybrid of **GenAI (LLMs)** and **Non-GenAI** (deterministic/symbolic) approaches to solve complex reasoning tasks.
* **Intelligent Orchestration:** Designing high-performance **Data Retrieval** strategies and **Multi-Agent Protocols** tailored for the strict consistency and security requirements of the banking and financial sector.
* **Autonomous Workflows:** Building and scaling infrastructure for autonomous agents, ensuring reliable communication and state management in distributed AI ecosystems.

### Academic Research (ITA)
Parallel to my professional work, I am a Master's Researcher at the  **Technological Institute of Aeronautics [ITA](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/technological-institute-aeronautics)**. My academic investigation focuses on the **MECADE** model a framework designed to integrate Chaos Engineering into the dependability assessment of financial institutions, ensuring that the global economy’s digital backbone remains resilient under pressure.

### The Paradox of the Generalist Specialist

In a world that often rewards narrow specialization, I embrace the paradox of being a generalist with specialist depth. My curiosity is systematic, not scattered. I seek patterns, abstractions, and hidden connections across disciplines, transforming complexity into coherent mental models and practical solutions.

My daily discipline is shaped by a commitment to growth across intellectual, technical, leadership, and creative dimensions. Progress, to me, is not about accumulation, but about integration. Seeing further by connecting what others treat as isolated domains.

### Systems, Patterns & The Architecture of Depth

My work in high-criticality technology is guided by more than just code; it is driven by a continuous search for **structural coherence**. I believe that complex ecosystems - much like human thought - require a solid foundation where logic and clarity prevail over superficial speed.

This perspective shapes my technical delivery and leadership through three core pillars:

* **Pattern & Anomaly Detection:** My acute sensitivity to structures allows me to identify "logic bugs" and inconsistencies in complex architectures before they escalate into critical failures. Where others see noise, I seek the invisible geometry that sustains the system.
* **Abyssal Focus on High-Stakes Problems:** In mission-critical environments, I prioritize long-term integrity and resilience. I replace the pursuit of quick, surface-level fixes with a deep investigation into the essence of the problem, ensuring that the resulting solution is sustainable and scalable.
* **Leadership through Sensory Clarity:** In collaborative environments, I act as a point of gravity for the team. My communication aims to reduce relational ambiguity by focusing on clarity of intent and technical honesty. This fosters a high-trust environment where excellence is the standard and collaboration occurs without the "masks" that often hinder large-scale projects.

I navigate complex challenges through non-linear thinking, transforming what might be perceived as "unconventional" into a unique ability to solve problems that cannot be reduced to simple binaries. For me, technology is the medium to scale this depth, ensuring that critical systems operate with the same precision and quiet strength as a well-executed masterpiece.

### 🌊 The Ocean as Compass

> "The ocean is a reminder of scale, depth, and the humility required to navigate vast systems."

Beyond the digital architecture, my discipline is forged and balanced through three fundamental pillars:

#### 🥋 The Strategy of Movement
In **Jiu-Jitsu**, I find a mirror to my work in engineering. It is an exercise in the **economy of movement** and the chess-like detection of leverage. Solving a high-stakes architectural problem requires the same mindset: identifying the pivot point where minimal effort yields maximum systemic resilience.

#### 🧘 Systemic Rigos
I treat wellness and body conditioning not as a hobby, but as a maintenance protocol for the **human hardware**. I apply the same rigor to physical health that I demand from high-stakes code-optimizing for longevity, recovery, and peak performance under pressure.

#### 🎸 Harmonic Architecture
My relationship with **classical guitar and electric guitar** reflects the way I view system integration. Classical guitar, in particular, requires a high level of **metacognitive independence**-managing multiple voices and complex rhythms simultaneously to create a single, coherent harmony. It is the art of polyphonic synchronization, much like managing distributed agentic protocols.

#### 🖋️ The Geometry of Truth
My creative expression finds a home in the quiet precision of **Nanquim drawing**. It is a practice of:
* **Contrast:** Distinguishing signal from noise.
* **Restraint:** Knowing what to omit to reveal the essence.
* **Intention:** Every stroke is a deliberate commitment.

***

In every domain-whether on the mat, the strings, the paper, or the codebase-I seek the **"geometry of truth"** that only emerges when the noise of the world is stripped away.
