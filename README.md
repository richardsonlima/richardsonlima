### Hi there 👋

In an ever-shifting technological landscape where complexity often outpaces abstraction, I design resilient, intelligence-driven ecosystems. As a Software, Data, and Machine Learning Engineer, my current focus lies at the frontier of Applied GenAI: engineering sophisticated agent patterns and multi-agent protocols. My work transcends system delivery; it is about designing digital environments that scale human potential, allowing engineers to operate with profound clarity, autonomy, and purpose.

# About Me

With over 15 years of experience architecting and securing large-scale technology environments, my career has been a journey through the core of computing: from the rigors of **UNIX Systems Administration** and **Offensive Security** to the modern paradigms of **Software Engineering, CloudOps, DevOps, SRE, and DataOps.**

Today, my professional focus has converged at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and advanced Machine Learning techniques** within the high-stakes world of Banking and Financial Technology.



### Professional Evolution & Current Focus
After a career mastering the full stack of modern infrastructure, I am now fully dedicated to the frontier of **Applied Artificial Intelligence**:

* **Agentic AI Architecture:** Engineering sophisticated **Agent Patterns** using a hybrid of **GenAI (LLMs)** and **deterministic/symbolic** approaches to solve complex reasoning tasks.
* **Intelligent Orchestration:** Designing high-performance **Data Retrieval** strategies and **Multi-Agent Protocols** tailored for the strict consistency and security requirements of the financial sector.
* **Autonomous Workflows:** Building and scaling infrastructure for autonomous agents: ensuring reliable communication and state management in distributed AI ecosystems.

### Academic Research (ITA)
Parallel to my professional work, I am a Master's Researcher at the **Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA)**. My academic investigation focuses on the **MECADE** model: a framework designed to integrate Chaos Engineering into the dependability assessment of financial institutions, ensuring that the global economy’s digital backbone remains resilient under pressure.

### The Paradox of the Generalist Specialist

In a world that often rewards narrow specialization, I embrace the paradox of being a generalist with specialist depth. My curiosity is systematic, not scattered: I seek patterns, abstractions, and hidden connections across disciplines, transforming complexity into coherent mental models and practical solutions.

My daily discipline is shaped by a commitment to growth across intellectual, technical, leadership, and creative dimensions. Progress, to me, is not about accumulation, but about integration: seeing further by connecting what others treat as isolated domains.

### Systems, Patterns & The Architecture of Depth

My work in high-criticality technology is guided by more than just code; it is driven by a continuous search for **structural coherence**. I believe that complex ecosystems, much like human thought, require a solid foundation where logic and clarity prevail over superficial speed.

This perspective shapes my technical delivery and leadership through three core pillars:

* **Pattern & Anomaly Detection:** My acute sensitivity to structures allows me to identify logic inconsistencies in complex architectures before they escalate into critical failures. Where others see noise, I seek the invisible geometry that sustains the system.
* **Abyssal Focus on High-Stakes Problems:** In mission-critical environments, I prioritize long-term integrity and resilience. I replace the pursuit of quick, surface-level fixes with a deep investigation into the essence of the problem: ensuring that the resulting solution is sustainable and scalable.
* **Leadership through Sensory Clarity:** In collaborative environments, I act as a point of gravity for the team. My communication aims to reduce relational ambiguity by focusing on clarity of intent and technical honesty. This fosters a high-trust environment where excellence is the standard and collaboration occurs without the masks that often hinder large-scale projects.

I navigate complex challenges through non-linear thinking: transforming what might be perceived as unconventional into a unique ability to solve problems that cannot be reduced to simple binaries. For me, technology is the medium to scale this depth: ensuring that critical systems operate with the precision and quiet strength of a well-executed masterpiece.

### 🌊 The Ocean as Compass

> "The ocean is a reminder of scale, depth, and the humility required to navigate vast systems."

Beyond the digital architecture, my discipline is forged and balanced through three fundamental pillars:

#### 🥋 The Strategy of Movement
In **Jiu-Jitsu**, I find a mirror to my work in engineering. It is an exercise in the **economy of movement** and the chess-like detection of leverage. Solving a high-stakes architectural problem requires the same mindset: identifying the pivot point where minimal esforço yields maximum systemic resilience.

#### 🧘 Systemic Rigor
I treat wellness and body conditioning not as a hobby, but as a maintenance protocol for the **human hardware**. I apply the same rigor to physical health that I demand from high-stakes code: optimizing for longevity, recovery, and peak performance under pressure.

#### 🎸 Harmonic Architecture
My relationship with **classical guitar** reflects the way I view system integration. It requires a high level of **metacognitive independence**: managing multiple voices and complex rhythms simultaneously to create a single, coherent harmony. It is the art of polyphonic synchronization: much like managing distributed agentic protocols.

#### 🖋️ The Geometry of Truth
My creative expression finds a home in the quiet precision of **Nanquim drawing**. It is a practice of contrast: distinguishing signal from noise; restraint: knowing what to omit to reveal the essence; and intention: every stroke is a deliberate commitment.

***

In every domain, whether on the mat, the strings, the paper, or the codebase, I seek the **"geometry of truth"** that only emerges when the noise of the world is stripped away.
