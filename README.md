In the ever-shifting landscape of technology, where the boundaries of possibility are constantly redrawn, I stand as a Data & Software Engineer navigating the cloud-native and data-driven era. My work goes beyond building systems; it is about shaping digital ecosystems and intelligent platforms that empower the creators of tomorrow.  

With a strong foundation in UNIX internals, SRE, DevOps, DataOps, and Red team offensive security (pentest), my career has been deeply focused on Software Engineering, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I design and implement architectures, toolchains, and workflows that give engineers unprecedented autonomy. This integrated approach‚Äîembodied in Internal Developer Platforms and modern data platforms‚Äîis more than a collection of tools: it is a catalyst for innovation, supporting the ful...
Parallel to this technological journey, I am pursuing a Master of Science degree at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology ([ITA](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/technological-institute-aeronautics)). There, I dive deeper into the intricate weave of science and technology, sharpening the tools of my trade and bridging theory with practice‚Äîa true fusion of mind and matter.

### The Paradox of the Generalist Specialist

In a world that often demands narrow specialization, I embrace the paradox of being a generalist with the precision of a specialist. Curiosity drives me: a restless pursuit of knowledge that knows no boundaries. My mind thrives on connections, weaving ideas across disciplines into a coherent whole.  

My path is shaped by a daily commitment to elevate potential across intellectual, academic, leadership, psychomotor, and artistic realms. It is not merely about being more; it is about seeing more‚Äîtracing the hidden threads that bind seemingly disparate domains.

The ocean is my metaphor and muse, a reminder of infinite possibilities. My passions extend to jiujitsu, wellness, body conditioning, networking, and the delicate art of Nanquim drawing, where sharp contrasts capture the essence of existence in bold strokes.

### The Art of Sound

Music is a language beyond language, a geometry of the soul, a vibration where time folds into eternity. As a guitarist, I traverse its landscapes as one might walk through galaxies: each note a star, each silence a void that breathes meaning.  

Every genre opens a different portal‚ÄîJazz whispers patterns like constellations, Texas blues cries like an ancient ocean, and Progressive Rock paints horizons where imagination burns brighter than the sun. These pieces form my personal cosmology, a surreal atlas of sound:

‚ö° I find inspiration in the works of [V√≠kingur √ìlafsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3-rNMhIyuQ), [Stjepan Hauser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn1gcjuhlhg), [Ludovico Einaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70cfoPloJq8), [Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kottjfEd7Zw), [√ìlafur Arnalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb34JCz5wvY&t=1213s), and [Max Richter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_YHE4Sx-08).

### Inspirational Quotes

‚ÄúListen within yourself and look into the infinitude of Space and Time. There can be heard the songs of the Constellations, the voices of the Numbers, and the harmonies of the Spheres.‚Äù  

‚ÄúThe present issues from the past, and the future from the present. Everything is made one by this continuity. Time is like a circle, where all the points are so linked that one cannot say where it begins or ends, for all points precede and follow one another forever.‚Äù  

‚ÄúQuod enim est erit semper.‚Äù  

‚ÄúClose your eyes and let the mind expand. Let no fear of death or darkness arrest its course. Allow the mind to merge with Mind. Let it flow out upon the great curve of consciousness. Let it soar on the wings of the great bird of duration, up to the very Circle of Eternity.‚Äù  

‚ÄúIn this vast cosmos of knowledge, technology, and art, I find myself not just as an observer but as a participant‚Äîa creator of systems, a seeker of truth, and a weaver of dreams. The future is not something that happens; it is something we tune into, like a hidden frequency of the universe.‚Äù
